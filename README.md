# Natural Language for Asset Pricing

Traditional models for asset pricing, such as the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT), and the Black-Scholes model, have relied on linear relationships between risk factors and returns, focusing primarily on financial metrics like market risk and volatility. These models, while foundational, often fail to capture the complex, non-linear interactions present in modern financial markets and broader economic factors.

Recent research, such as (Deep Learning for Asset Pricing by Chen et al. (2023))[https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00745] and (Structural Deep Learning in Conditional Asset Pricing by Fan et al. (2022))[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4117882], demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning in handling the non-linearities and time-varying dynamics of asset prices. These approaches leverage advanced techniques like feed-forward networks, LSTMs, and GANs to incorporate a wide range of economic and firm-specific factors, providing a more flexible and data-driven method for predicting future prices and risk premiums.
